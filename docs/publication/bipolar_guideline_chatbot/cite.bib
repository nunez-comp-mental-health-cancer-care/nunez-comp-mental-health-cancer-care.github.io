	abstract = {Objective Clinical practice guidelines support evidence-based care but are often underused due to complexity, time constraints, and navigation challenges. We investigated whether a conversational agent (chatbot) using an open-weight large language model (LLM) with retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) could provide guideline-consistent answers for bipolar disorder management based on the full 2018 CANMAT and ISBD guidelines, comparing against a system using only the base LLM.Method We developed a multi-step RAG-based chatbot that retrieves relevant guideline sections and generates responses using Llama 3.3 70B. Twenty-one clinical vignettes spanning all guideline sections were created. Six expert psychiatrists generated queries and were presented with paired responses without labels from two systems: one using the base Llama 3.3 70B model, the other RAG-enhanced. Responses rated guideline consistency on a three-point scale, and were analyzed using mixed-effects ordinal logistic regression.Results Experts evaluated 126 responses, of which 110 (87.3\%) were rated as more or as correct as the baseline system. The RAG system produced 80 answers (63.5\%) rated fully consistent with the guidelines versus 24 (19.0\%) for baseline, and only 10 answers with major deviation (7.9\%) versus 48 (38.1\%) for baseline. Ordinal regression showed RAG responses were significantly more likely to be more correct (OR = 9.1, 95\% CI 5.3{\textendash}16.3, p \&lt; 0.001), which was consistent across all raters. Preference ratings favored RAG answers in 78.7\% of cases. Performance varied by vignette, with some errors in both retrieval and reasoning.Conclusion The use of RAG with an open-weight model helped produce answers consistent with the CANMAT guidelines across vignettes that required adapting or combining guideline text, suggesting viability of a bipolar guideline chatbot. We identified areas to improve results and evaluation. Future work should explore additional retrieval strategies and LLMs, and test in more naturalistic settings.Competing Interest StatementJohh-Jose Nunez received in kind support from Amazon Web Services Canada.

I confirm that any such study reported in the manuscript has been registered and the trial registration ID is provided (note: if posting a prospective study registered retrospectively, please provide a statement in the trial ID field explaining why the study was not registered in advance).YesI have followed all appropriate research reporting guidelines, such as any relevant EQUATOR Network research reporting checklist(s) and other pertinent material, if applicable.YesThe computer code used for our chatbot and evaluation will be available on a public GitHub repository upon publication. Given the potential for automatic scraping systems to use any publicly available data to train LLMs, which may impact planned immediate short-term work, the vignettes and question answer pairs will be made available upon reasonable request to the corresponding author within two years of publication.},
