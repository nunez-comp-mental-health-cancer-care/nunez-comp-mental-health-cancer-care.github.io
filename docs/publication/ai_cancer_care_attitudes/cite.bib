    abstract = {Background Artificial intelligence broadly refers to computer systems that simulate intelligent behaviour with minimal human intervention. Emphasizing patient-centered care, research has explored patients' perspectives on artificial intelligence in medical care, indicating general acceptance of the technology but also concerns about supervision. However, these views have not been systematically examined from the perspective of patients with cancer, whose opinions may differ given the distinct psychosocial toll of the disease. Objectives This protocol describes a scoping review aimed at summarizing the existing literature on the attitudes of patients with cancer toward the use of artificial intelligence in their medical care. The primary goal is to identify knowledge gaps and highlight opportunities for future research. Methods This scoping review protocol will adhere to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines (PRISMA-ScR). The electronic databases MEDLINE (OVID), EMBASE, PsycINFO, and CINAHL will be searched for peer-reviewed primary research articles published in academic journals. We will have two independent reviewers screen the articles retrieved from the literature search and select relevant studies based on our inclusion criteria, with a third reviewer resolving any disagreements. We will then compile the data from the included articles into a narrative summary and discuss the implications for clinical practice and future research. Discussion To our knowledge, this will be the first scoping review to map the existing literature on the attitudes of patients with cancer regarding artificial intelligence in their medical care.},
