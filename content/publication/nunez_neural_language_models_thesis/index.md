abstract: "Cancer is associated not only with mortality, but also with impacts on physical, mental, and social health. When unmet, psychosocial needs are associated with worsened quality-of-life and survival. This dissertation investigates the use of neural language models to predict psychosocial needs of cancer patients from clinical documents."
