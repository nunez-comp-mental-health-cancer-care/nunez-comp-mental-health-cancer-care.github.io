    abstract = {Patients with cancer often have unmet psychosocial needs. Early detection of who requires referral to a counsellor or psychiatrist may improve their care. This work used natural language processing to predict which patients will see a counsellor or psychiatrist from a patient's initial oncology consultation document. We believe this is the first use of artificial intelligence to predict psychiatric outcomes from non-psychiatric medical documents. This retrospective prognostic study used data from 47,625 patients at BC Cancer. We analyzed initial oncology consultation documents using traditional and neural language models to predict whether patients would see a counsellor or psychiatrist in the 12 months following their initial oncology consultation. Here, we show our best models achieved a balanced accuracy (receiver-operating-characteristic area-under-curve) of 73.1\% (0.824) for predicting seeing a psychiatrist, and 71.0\% (0.784) for seeing a counsellor. Different words and phrases are important for predicting each outcome. These results suggest natural language processing can be used to predict psychosocial needs of patients with cancer from their initial oncology consultation document. Future research could extend this work to predict the psychosocial needs of medical patients in other settings. Patients with cancer often need support for their mental health. Early detection of who requires referral to a counsellor or psychiatrist may improve their care. This study trained a type of artificial intelligence (AI) called natural language processing to read the consultation report an oncologist writes after they first see a patient to predict which patients will see a counsellor or psychiatrist. The AI predicted this with performance similar to other uses of AI in mental health, and used different words and phrases to predict who would see a psychiatrist compared to seeing a counsellor. We believe this is the first use of AI to predict mental health outcomes from medical documents written by clinicians outside of mental health. This study suggests this type of AI can predict the mental health needs of patients with cancer from this widely-available document. Nunez et al. investigate the use of natural language processing to predict which patients with cancer will see a psychiatrist or counselling using the initial oncology consultation document. Their study supports the use of such techniques with widely-available medical documents to better address the psychosocial needs of cancer patients.},
