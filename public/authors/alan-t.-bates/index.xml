Different linguistic patterns predict psychiatrist versus counselor referrals, providing clinically relevant insights for patient care.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Predicting the Survival of Patients With Cancer From Their Initial Oncology Consultation Document Using Natural Language Processing</title><link>https://example.com/publication/cancer_survival_nlp/</link><pubDate>Mon, 27 Feb 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://example.com/publication/cancer_survival_nlp/</guid><description>&lt;p>This study demonstrates that natural language processing applied to initial oncology consultation documents can effectively predict patient survival outcomes across multiple cancer types. The models perform comparably with or better than previous prediction models while using readily available clinical data.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Supportive Care and Health Care Service Utilization in Older Adults with a New Cancer Diagnosis: A Population Based Review in British Columbia, Canada</title><link>https://example.com/publication/supportive_care_cancer_bc/</link><pubDate>Sun, 01 Jan 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://example.com/publication/supportive_care_cancer_bc/</guid><description>&lt;p>This publication examines supportive care and health care service utilization patterns in older adults with new cancer diagnoses in British Columbia.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
